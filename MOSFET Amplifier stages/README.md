# MOSFET Analog Amplifier Stages

This repository contains implementations and notes on commonly used MOSFET small-signal amplifier stages.  
Each folder corresponds to one topology, including its schematic, operating principle, and key equations.

MOSFET amplifiers are widely used because of their high input impedance, low power consumption, and ease of integration in ICs. Different configurations trade off gain, linearity, bandwidth, and impedance to suit different applications such as voltage amplification, buffering, and RF front-ends.
