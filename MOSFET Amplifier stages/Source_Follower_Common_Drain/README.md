## Source Follower (Common-Drain) Amplifier

A voltage buffer implemented using an NMOS transistor with the output taken from the source terminal. The source follower provides high input impedance, low output impedance, and a voltage gain slightly less than unity with no phase inversion. It is commonly used for impedance matching and buffering between circuit stages.

- **Gain:** gm*Rs/(1 + gm*Rs)  
- High input impedance and low output impedance  
- No phase inversion (0° phase shift)  
- Voltage gain slightly less than 1  

This directory contains the design and LTspice simulation of an NMOS source follower (common-drain) amplifier. The implementation focuses on simplicity and practical biasing using discrete components.
