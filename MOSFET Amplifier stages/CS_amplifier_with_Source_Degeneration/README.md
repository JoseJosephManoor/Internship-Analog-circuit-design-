A basic voltage amplifier using a drain resistor and a source degeneration resistor. It provides moderate gain with 180° phase inversion.

- Gain: Av = -gm.RD/(1+gm.RS)
- Improved linearity and gain stability
- Lower gain compared to the basic CS stage

This directory contains the design and LTspice simulation of an NMOS common-source amplifier with source degeneration. This project focuses on the NMOS implementation to keep the scope concise and practical.
